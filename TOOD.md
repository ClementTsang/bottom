# To-Do List

* ~~Get each function working as a POC~~

* ~~Separate each component for readability, finalize project structure~~

* ~~Refreshing - how are we doing that?  Are we allowing individual refresh periods per component?~~

* Write tui display

* Charting?

* Keybindings

* Theming

* Efficiency!!!  Make sure no wasted hashmaps, use references, etc.
