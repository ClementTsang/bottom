# To-Do List

* Get each function working as a POC

* Separate each component for readability, finalize project structure

* Refreshing - how are we doing that?  Are we allowing individual refresh periods per component?

* Write cursive display

* Charting?

* Keybindings

* Theming

* Efficiency!!!  Make sure no wasted hashmaps, use references, etc.
