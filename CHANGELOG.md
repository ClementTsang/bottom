### Other

- Various Travis changes.

## [0.2.2] - 2020-02-26

### Features

- Added support for colouring the average CPU core separately in config files.

- [#15](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/15) - Added support for (some) named colours and RGB values in config files.

### Bug Fixes

- [#14](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/14): Ignore certain characters in search

## [0.2.1] - 2020-02-21

### Bug Fixes

- [#14](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/11): Fixed default config paths not being read properly.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-02-20

### Features

- Searching in processes was added.

- The option of a config file was added. Config files follow the TOML spec. These support boot flags by default, and colour schemes.

- The capability of maximizing a widget to take up all draw space was added.

- Filtering out CPU cores on the graph/legend was added.

### Changes

- Default colours were changed for better support on macOS Terminal and PowerShell.

- Rewrote and refactored how I get data to be less spaghetti. This might also have the added benefit of running better, with less duplicated logic.

- Changed how the dd dialog and help dialog look. Hopefully they'll be nicer to look at and more intuitive to use!

### Bug Fixes

- [#2](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/2): Fixed issues where the program would crash if the window was too small.

- Added a panic handler so terminals won't get all broken if a panic _does_ still occur.

- Fixed some sizing issues, hopefully this means that it's still readable at smaller sizes (within reason).

- [#10](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/10): Fixed scroll issue caused by resizing.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-01-11

### Changes

- Added a bit more complexity to how we determine column widths for tables. This should fix an issue where columns would glitch out at smaller widths, and hopefully look nicer.

### Bug Fixes

- Rewrote scroll logic in tables to avoid some strange scroll behaviour I encountered where it would jump around.

- Attempt to patch a panic caused by the change in how we determine time in the data collection stage.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-01-11

### Features

- `Tab` in the processes widget will now group similarly-named processes together (as well as their total CPU and MEM usage). `dd`-ing this will try to kill all entries with that process name.

- A flag to enable this by default is also now available.

### Bug Fixes

- Accidentally left in a bug in which the disk widget was using megabytes instead of bytes as their unit during data collection... but during data conversion for the display I treated them as bytes.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-11

Initial release.
