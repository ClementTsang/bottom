One example of this is seeing a bunch of missing font characters, caused when the terminal isn't configured properly to render braille fonts. Powershell shown missing braille fonts One alternative is to use the --dot_marker option to render graph charts using dots instead of the braille characters, which generally seems better supported out of the box, at the expense of looking less intricate: Example using btm --dot_marker Another (better) alternative is to install a font that supports braille fonts, and configure your terminal to use it. For example, installing something like UBraille or Iosevka and ensuring your terminal uses it should work. Installing fonts for Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell Note: I would advise backing up your registry beforehand if you aren't sure what you are doing! Let's say you're installing Iosevka . The steps you can take are: Install the font itself. Open the registry editor, which you can do either by Win+R and opening regedit , or just opening it from the Start Menu. In the registry editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Console\\TrueTypeFont Here, add a new String value , and set the Name to a bunch of 0's (e.g. 000 - make sure the name isn't already used), then set the Data to the font name (e.g. Iosevka ). The last entry is the new entry for Iosevka Then, open the Command Prompt/PowerShell, and right click on the top bar, and open Properties : From here, go to Font , and set the font to your new font (e.g. Iosevka ): Why can't I see all my temperature sensors on Windows? This is a known limitation , some sensors may require admin privileges to get sensor data. Why don't I see dual batteries on Windows reported separately? (e.g. Thinkpads) This is a known limitation which seems to be with how batteries are being detected on Windows. Why can't I see all my temperature sensors on WSL? This is a known limitation with WSL. Due to how it works, hosts may not expose their temperature sensors and therefore, temperature sensors might be missing. Why does WSL2 not match Task Manager? This is a known limitation with WSL2. Due to how WSL2 works, the two might not match up in terms of reported data. Why can't I see all my processes/process data on macOS? This is a known limitation , and you may have to run the program with elevated privileges to work around it - for example: sudo btm Please note that you should be certain that you trust any software you grant root privileges. There are measures taken to try to maximize the amount of information obtained without elevated privileges. For example, one can modify the instructions found on the htop wiki on how to run htop without sudo for bottom. However please understand the potential security risks before doing so! My configuration file isn't working If your configuration files aren't working, here are a few things to try: Check the formatting It may be handy to refer to the automatically generated config files or the sample configuration files . The config files also follow the TOML format. Also make sure your config options are under the right table - for example, to set your temperature type, you must set it under the [flags] table: [flags] temperature_type = \"f\" Meanwhile, if you want to set a custom color scheme, it would be under the [colors] table: [colors] table_header_color = \"LightBlue\" Check the configuration file location Make sure bottom is reading the right configuration file. By default, bottom looks for config files at these locations: OS Default Config Location macOS $HOME/Library/Application Support/bottom/bottom.toml ~/.config/bottom/bottom.toml $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bottom/bottom.toml Linux ~/.config/bottom/bottom.toml $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bottom/bottom.toml Windows C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Roaming\\bottom\\bottom.toml If you want to use a config file in another location, use the --config or -C flags along with the path to the configuration file, like so: btm -C path_to_config My installation through snap has some widgets that are blank/show no data Make sure bottom is given the correct permissions in order to collect data.

Features Expansion By default, bottom is somewhat like a dashboard - a bunch of different widgets, all showing different things, and they all cram together to fit into one terminal. If you instead just want to see one widget - maybe you want to look at a graph in more detail, for example - you can \"expand\" the currently selected widget using the e key, which will hide all other widgets and make that widget take up all available terminal space. You can leave this state by either pressing e again or pressing Esc . Widget selection To allow for widget-specific keybindings and expansion, there is the idea of widget selection in bottom, where you can focus on a specific widget to work with it. This can be done with the mouse (just click on the widget of interest) or keyboard (ex: Ctrl + Direction , see Key bindings for alternatives). Key bindings These are global or common keyboard shortcuts for the application, which you can see in-app through the ? shortcut. Note that key bindings are generally case-sensitive.

Features The process widget has three main components: The main process table The search sub-widget (opened with Ctrl + f or / ) The sort menu sub-widget (opened with s or F6 ) By default, the main process table displays the following information for each process: PID Name of the process CPU use percentage (note this is averaged out per available thread) Memory use percentage Reads per second Writes per second Total amount read Total amount written User State Sorting The table can be sorted by clicking on the table headers, which will either sort the table by that column, or if already sorting by that column, reverse the sorting order. Alternatively, one can sort using the sort menu sub-widget, which is brought up using s or F6 , and can be controlled by arrow keys or the mouse. Grouping Pressing Tab in the table will group entries with the same name together. The PID column will be replaced with the number of entries in each group, and usage is added together when displayed. Note that the process state and user columns are disabled in this mode. Tree mode Pressing t or F5 in the table toggles tree mode in the process widget, displaying processes in regards to their parent-child process relationships. A process in tree mode can also be \"collapsed\", hiding its children and any descendants, using either the - or + keys, or double clicking on an entry. Lastly, note that in tree mode, processes cannot be grouped together due to the behaviour of the two modes somewhat clashing. Full command You can show the full command instead of just the process name by pressing P . Search Pressing / or Ctrl + f will open up the search sub-widget. By default, just typing in something will search by the process name. This search can be further enhanced by matching by case, matching the entire word, or by regex. We are able to also search for multiple things/conditions. And if our search uses a keyword, we need to use quotation marks around the term to properly search it. Lastly, we can refine our search even further based on the other columns, like PID, CPU usage, etc., as well as grouping together conditions. You can also paste search queries (e.g. Shift + Ins , Ctrl + Shift + v ). Keywords Note all keywords are case-insensitive. To search for a process/command that collides with a keyword, surround the term with quotes (e.x. \"cpu\" ).
