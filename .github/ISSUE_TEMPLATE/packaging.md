## Details

What is the issue? Please be clear and concise.

Some notes:

- If the issue is specifically about an existing package/distribution, consider contacting the package maintainer
  instead in the appropriate location.

- If this issue is about supporting a new package manager/installation method,
  please do consider maintaining it yourself and sending in a PR, and I'll be glad accept it!
  See [the documentation](https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom/nightly/contribution/packaging-and-distribution/) for more information.
