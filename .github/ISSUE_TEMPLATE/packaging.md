## Describe the issue

What is the packaging-related issue? Please be clear and concise.

**Please note:**

- If the issue is specifically about an existing package/distribution, please be aware that the maintainers of this project only
  manage the distributions of bottom on:

  - crates.io
  - Chocolatey
  - Binary releases on GitHub

  **Outside of these releases, if there are issues with packaging/repo/distribution, consider first contacting whoever is handling those release channels where appropriate, as maintainers here may not be able to provide much assistance.**

- If this issue is about supporting a new package manager/installation method, please consider maintaining it yourself
  and sending in a PR/issue with a link to it, and I'll be happy to add it to the list in the README. See
  [the documentation](https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom/nightly/contribution/packaging-and-distribution/) for more information.
