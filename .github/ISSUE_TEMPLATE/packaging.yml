        If this is an issue about supporting a new package/installation method for a platform you use, please
        consider maintaining it yourself/with others and submitting a PR or issue with a link to it - they'll be
        very much appreciated and likely added to the README quickly. [The documentation on packaging/distribution](https://clementtsang.github.io/bottom/nightly/contribution/packaging-and-distribution/)
        may be helpful in setting things up. If there are some issues with bottom itself causing problems with
        packaging, feel free to open an appropriate issue.


        If this is an issue regarding a specific existing distribution channel, feel free to report issues here if they
        are related to the following sources:

          * [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bottom)
          * [Binary releases/packages released on GitHub](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases)


        For any other distribution channel, please first try to contact the package maintainers where appropriate
        to get help regarding distribution-specific issues (e.g. the package has issues installing, the package
        is outdated, etc.) before reaching out here. This is as while I am happy to help where possible, I do not
        personally use many of the various ways people distribute bottom. As such, unless specified, I might lack the
        platform-specific context, knowledge, or tools to be able to help you at all regarding the distribution method,
        and the best I can do is just point you to the package maintainer.

        Example: Would it be possible to add shell completion generation as a separate build artifact?
