## Describe the bug

_A clear and concise description of what the bug is and what the expected behaviour was. If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem:_

## To reproduce

_Steps on how to reproduce the behaviour:_

1. Go to...
2. Click on...
3. See error

## bottom version (use `btm -V`)

_Tell me which version of bottom you installed. If you're not on the latest version, does using that fix the problem?_

## bottom config file (if one is used) or flags

_If you're using a config file or running with specific flags, please include it in the report._

## Installation method

_How did you install bottom? Note if it's not a supported method, I may not be able to help you. Also ensure that any performance bug reports are **not** only replicable on debug mode (`cargo run`)._

## Platform Information

### Operating system, OS version, and architecture

_Please specify your operating system, the version, and architecture, so I can try to replicate as best as possible._

### Terminal (i.e. urxvt, kitty, etc.)

_Sometimes this matters, so please mention your terminal/terminal emulator._

### Shell (i.e. zsh, bash, etc.)

_Again, sometimes this matters, so please mention your shell if possible._

### System info

_Not totally necessary, but if possible, include details like:_

_RAM size:_

_SWAP size:_

### Rust version

_Check this with `rustc --version`. This is only relevant if your version of bottom isn't from a pre-built binary (i.e. Cargo). Otherwise, feel free to skip._
