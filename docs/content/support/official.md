# Official support

bottom _officially_ supports the following operating systems and corresponding architectures:

- macOS (`x86_64`, `aarch64`)
- Linux (`x86_64`, `i686`, `aarch64`)
- Windows (`x86_64`, `i686`)

These platforms are tested to work (with caveats, see below) and issues on these platforms will be fixed if possible.

Furthermore, binaries are expected to be built and tested using the most recent version of stable Rust - if you are manually building
bottom from the repo/source, then please try that as well.

If you encounter any issues, see the [troubleshooting page](../troubleshooting.md) or open an issue/discussion on GitHub.
