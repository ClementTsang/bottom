# Unofficial support

Systems and architectures that aren't officially supported may still work, but there are no guarantees on how much will
work. For example, it might only compile, or it might run with bugs/broken features. Furthermore, while it will depend
on the problem at the end of the day, _issues on unsupported platforms are likely to go unfixed_.

Unofficially supported platforms known to compile/work:

- FreeBSD
- Linux on ARMv7 and ARMv6 (tested to compile in [CI](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml))
- Linux on PowerPC 64 LE (tested to compile in [CI](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml))
- Linux on an RISC-V (tested to compile in [CI](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml), tested to run on an [Allwinner D1 Nezha](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/issues/564))

## Known problems
