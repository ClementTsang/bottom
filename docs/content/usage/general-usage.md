# General Usage

You can run bottom with:

```bash
btm
```

For help regarding the command-line flags, use:

```bash
# For a simple overview of flags
btm -h

# For more details
btm --help
```

## Features

### Expansion

By default, bottom is somewhat like a dashboard - a bunch of different widgets, all showing different things, and they all cram together to fit into one terminal.

If you instead just want to see _one_ widget - maybe you want to look at a graph in more detail, for example - you can "expand" the currently selected
widget using the ++e++ key, which will hide all other widgets and make that widget take up all available terminal space.

You can leave this state by either pressing ++e++ again or pressing ++esc++.

### Widget selection

To allow for widget-specific keybindings and expansion, there is the idea of _widget selection_ in bottom, where you can focus on a specific widget to work with it.
This can be done with the mouse (just click on the widget of interest) or keyboard (ex: ++ctrl+"Direction"++, see [Key bindings](#key-bindings) for alternatives).

## Key bindings

These are global or common keyboard shortcuts for the application, which you can see in-app through the ++question++ shortcut.
Note that key bindings are generally case-sensitive.
