# Process Widget

The process widget displays a table containing information regarding a running process, along with sorting,
searching, and process control features.

## Features

The process widget has three main components:

- The main process table
- The search sub-widget (opened with ++ctrl+f++ or ++slash++)
- The sort menu sub-widget (opened with ++s++ or ++f6++)

By default, the main process table displays the following information for each process:

- PID
- Name of the process
- CPU use percentage (note this is averaged out per available thread)
- Memory use percentage
- Reads per second
- Writes per second
- Total amount read
- Total amount written
- User
- State

### Sorting

The table can be sorted by clicking on the table headers, which will either sort the table by that column, or if already
sorting by that column, reverse the sorting order.

Alternatively, one can sort using the sort menu sub-widget, which is brought up using ++s++ or ++f6++, and can be controlled by arrow keys or the mouse.

</figure>

### Grouping

Pressing ++tab++ in the table will group entries with the same name together. The PID column will be replaced with the number of entries in each group, and usage
is added together when displayed.

</figure>

Note that the process state and user columns are disabled in this mode.

### Tree mode

Pressing ++t++ or ++f5++ in the table toggles tree mode in the process widget, displaying processes in regards to their parent-child process relationships.

</figure>

A process in tree mode can also be "collapsed", hiding its children and any descendants, using either the ++minus++ or ++plus++ keys, or double clicking on an entry.

Lastly, note that in tree mode, processes cannot be grouped together due to the behaviour of the two modes somewhat clashing.

### Full command

You can show the full command instead of just the process name by pressing ++P++.

</figure>

### Search

Pressing ++slash++ or ++ctrl+f++ will open up the search sub-widget. By default, just typing in something will search by the process name.

<figure>
    <img src="../../../assets/screenshots/process/search/search.webp" alt="A picture of searching for a process with a simple search."/>
</figure>

This search can be further enhanced by matching by case, matching the entire word, or by regex.

<figure>
    <img src="../../../assets/screenshots/process/search/regex.webp" alt="A picture of searching for a process with a search condition that uses regex."/>
</figure>

We are able to also search for multiple things/conditions.

<figure>
    <img src="../../../assets/screenshots/process/search/or.webp" alt="A picture of searching for a process with a search condition that uses the or operator."/>
</figure>

And if our search uses a keyword, we need to use quotation marks around the term to properly search it.

</figure>

Lastly, we can refine our search even further based on the other columns, like PID, CPU usage, etc., as well as grouping together conditions.

#### Keywords

Note all keywords are case-insensitive. To search for a process/command that collides with a keyword, surround the term with quotes (e.x. `"cpu"`).
