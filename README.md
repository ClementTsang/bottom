## Features

As yet _another_ process/system visualization and management application, bottom supports the typical features:

- CPU, memory, and network usage visualization

- Display information about disk capacity and I/O per second

- Display temperatures from sensors

- Display information regarding processes, like CPU, memory, and I/O usage

- Process management (process killing _is_ all you need, right?)

It also aims to be:

- Lightweight

- Cross-platform - supports Linux, Windows, and macOS

In addition to these things, bottom also currently has the following features:

### Process filtering

On any process widget, hit `/` to bring up a search bar. If your layout has
multiple process widgets, note this search is independent of other widgets. Searching
supports regex, matching case, and matching entire words. Use `Tab` to toggle between
searching by PID and by process name.

### Zoom

Using the `+`/`-` keys or the scroll wheel will move adjust the current time intervals of the currently selected widget, and `=` to reset the zoom levels to the default.
Widgets can hold different time intervals independently. These time intervals can be adjusted using the
`-t`/`--default_time_value` and `-d`/`--time_delta` options, or their corresponding config options.

### Maximizing

Only care about one specific widget? You can go to that widget and hit `Enter` to make that widget take
up the entire drawing area.

### Basic mode

Using the `-b` or `--basic_mode` (or their corresponding config options) will open bottom in basic mode.
There are no charts or expanded mode when using this, and tables are condensed such that only one table is displayed
at a time.

![basic mode image](assets/basic_mode.png)

Note custom layouts are currently not available when this is used.

### Config files

bottom supports reading from a config file to customize its behaviour and look. By default, bottom will look at `~/.config/bottom/bottom.toml` or `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\bottom\bottom.toml` on Unix and Windows systems respectively.

Note that if a config file does not exist at either the default location or the passed in location via `-C` or `--config`, one is automatically created with no settings applied.

#### Config flags

The following options can be set under `[flags]` to achieve the same effect as passing in a flag on runtime. Note that if a flag is given, it will override the config file.

These are the following supported flag config values:
| Field | Type |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `avg_cpu` | Boolean |
| `dot_marker` | Boolean |
| `left_legend` | Boolean |
| `current_usage` | Boolean |
| `group_processes` | Boolean |
| `case_sensitive` | Boolean |
| `whole_word` | Boolean |
| `regex` | Boolean |
| `show_disabled_data` | Boolean |
| `basic` | Boolean |
| `hide_table_count`| Boolean |
| `use_old_network_legend`| Boolean |
| `rate` | Unsigned Int (represents milliseconds) |
| `default_time_value` | Unsigned Int (represents milliseconds) |
| `time_delta` | Unsigned Int (represents milliseconds) |
| `temperature_type` | String (one of ["k", "f", "c", "kelvin", "fahrenheit", "celsius"]) |
| `default_widget_type` | String (one of ["cpu", "proc", "net", "temp", "mem", "disk"], same as layout options) |
| `default_widget_count` | Unsigned Int (represents which `default_widget_type`) |

#### Theming

The config file can be used to set custom colours for parts of the application under the `[colors]` object. The following labels are customizable with strings that are hex colours, RGB colours, or specific named colours.

Supported named colours are one of the following strings: `Reset, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue, LightMagenta, LightCyan, White`.

| Labels                          | Details                                               | Example                                                 |

#### Layout

bottom supports customizable layouts via the config file. Currently, layouts are controlled by using TOML objects and arrays.

For example, given the sample layout:

```toml
[[row]]
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
[[row]]
    ratio=2
    [[row.child]]
      ratio=4
      type="mem"
    [[row.child]]
      ratio=3
      [[row.child.child]]
        type="temp"
      [[row.child.child]]
        type="disk"
```

This would give a layout that has two rows, with a 1:2 ratio. The first row has only the CPU widget.
The second row is split into two columns with a 4:3 ratio. The first column contains the memory widget.
The second column is split into two rows with a 1:1 ratio. The first is the temperature widget, the second is the disk widget.

This is what the layout would look like when run:

![Sample layout](assets/sample_layout.png)

Each `[[row]]` represents a _row_ in the layout. A row can have any number of `child` values. Each `[[row.child]]`
represents either a _column or a widget_. A column can have any number of `child` values as well. Each `[[row.child.child]]`
represents a _widget_. A widget is represented by having a `type` field set to a string.

The following `type` values are supported:
| | |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `"cpu"` | CPU chart and legend |
| `"mem", "memory"` | Memory chart |
| `"net", "network"` | Network chart and legend |
| `"proc", "process", "processes"` | Process table and search |
| `"temp", "temperature"` | Temperature table |
| `"disk"` | Disk table |
| `"empty"` | An empty space |
| `"batt", "battery"` | Battery statistics |

Each component of the layout accepts a `ratio` value. If this is not set, it defaults to 1.

For an example, look at the [default config](./sample_configs/default_config.toml), which contains the default layout.

...and yes, you can have duplicate widgets. This means you could do something like:

```toml
[[row]]
  ratio=1
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
[[row]]
  ratio=1
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
  [[row.child]]
  type="empty"
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
[[row]]
  ratio=1
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
  [[row.child]]
  type="cpu"
```

and get the following CPU donut:

### Battery

You can get battery statistics (charge, time to fill/discharge, and consumption in watts) via the battery widget.
Since this is only useful for devices like laptops, it is off by default. Currently, the only way to use it is to set it
as a widget via [layouts](#layout).

So with this slightly silly layout:

```toml
[[row]]
  ratio=1
  [[row.child]]
  type="batt"
[[row]]
    ratio=2
    [[row.child]]
      ratio=4
      type="batt"
    [[row.child]]
      ratio=3
      [[row.child.child]]
        type="cpu"
      [[row.child.child]]
        type="batt"
```

You get this:

### Compatibility

The current compatibility of widgets with operating systems from personal testing:

| OS      | CPU | Memory | Disks | Temperature | Processes/Search | Networks | Battery                                      |
| ------- | --- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | ✓   | ✓      | ✓     | ✓           | ✓                | ✓        | ✓                                            |
| Windows | ✓   | ✓      | ✓     | ✗           | ✓                | ✓        | ✓ (seems to have issues with dual batteries) |
| macOS   | ✓   | ✓      | ✓     | ✓           | ✓                | ✓        | ✓                                            |

Please try to follow the given issue templates.

## Thanks

- This project is very much inspired by both
  [gotop](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop) and [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop).

- Basic mode is heavily inspired by [htop's](https://hisham.hm/htop/) design.

- This application was written with many, _many_ libraries, and built on the
  work of many talented people. This application would be impossible
  without their work.
