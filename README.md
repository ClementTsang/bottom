A cross-platform graphical process/system monitor with a customizable interface and a multitude of features. Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. Inspired by both [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop) and [gotop](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop).

![Quick demo recording showing off searching, maximizing, and process killing.](assets/summary_and_search.gif) _Terminal: Kitty Terminal, Font: IBM Plex Mono, OS: Arch Linux. Theme based on [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) (see [sample config](./sample_configs/demo_config.toml))._

## Features

Features of bottom include:

- CPU widget to show a visual representation of per-core (and optionally average) usage.

- Memory widget to show a visual representation of both RAM and SWAP usage.

- Networks widget to show a log-based visual representation of network usage.

- Sortable and searchable process widget. Searching supports regex, and you can search by PID and process name.

- Disks widget to display usage and I/O per second.

- Temperature widget to monitor detected sensors in your system.

- Flags to customize the display.

- Config file support for custom colours and default options.

- Maximizing of widgets of interest to take up the entire window.

- A minimal mode that focuses less on graphs and more on data, similar to [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/).

- Zooming in/out to see more/less data.

More details about each widget and compatibility can be found [here](./docs/widgets.md).

## Config files

For information about config files, see [this document](./docs/config.md) for more details, and this [config](./sample_configs/demo_config.toml) for an example.

## Installation

In all cases you can install the in-development version by cloning from this repo and using `cargo build --release`. This is built and tested with Rust Stable (1.42 as of writing).

In addition to the below methods, you can manually build from the [Releases](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases) page by downloading and building.

I officially support and test 64-bit versions of [Tier 1](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html) Rust targets. I will try to build and release 32-bit versions for Linux and Windows, but as of now, I will not be testing 32-bit for validity beyond building.

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install bottom
```

### Linux

Installation methods on a per-distro basis:

#### Arch Linux

You can get the release versions from the AUR by installing [`bottom`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bottom/) or [`bottom-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bottom-bin/). For example, using `yay`:

```bash
yay bottom
# Or
yay bottom-bin
```

#### Debian (and anything based on it, like Ubuntu)

A `.deb` file is provided on each [release](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases/latest):

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom/releases/download/0.2.2/bottom_0.2.2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i bottom_0.2.2_amd64.deb
```

### Windows

You can get release versions via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/bottom/):

```bash
choco install bottom
# Or
choco install bottom --version=0.2.2 # Version number may be required for newer releases
```

### macOS

You can get release versions using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap clementtsang/bottom
brew install bottom
# Or
brew install clementtsang/bottom/bottom
```

## Usage

Run using `btm`.

### Command line options

- `-h`, `--help` shows the help screen and exits.

- `-a`, `--avg_cpu` enables also showing the average CPU usage in addition to per-core CPU usage.

- `-m`, `--dot-marker` uses a dot marker instead of the default braille marker.

- Temperature units (you can only use one at a time):

  - `-c`, `--celsius` displays the temperature type in Celsius. This is the default.

  - `-f`, `--fahrenheit` displays the temperature type in Fahrenheit.

  - `-k`, `--kelvin` displays the temperature type in Kelvin.

- `-v`, `--version` displays the version number and exits.

- `-r <RATE>`, `--rate <RATE>` will set the refresh rate in _milliseconds_. Lowest it can go is 250ms, the highest it can go is 2<sup>64</sup> - 1. Defaults to 1000ms, and lower values may take more resources due to more frequent polling of data, and may be less accurate in some circumstances.

- `-l`, `--left_legend` will move external table legends to the left side rather than the right side. Right side is default.

- `-u`, `--current_usage` will make a process' CPU usage be based on the current total CPU usage, rather than assuming 100% CPU usage.

- `-g`, `--group` will group together processes with the same name by default (equivalent to pressing `Tab`).

- `-S`, `--case_sensitive` will default to matching case.

- `-W`, `--whole` will default to searching for the world word.

- `-R`, `--regex` will default to using regex.

- `--cpu_default`, `--memory_default`, `--disk_default`, `--temperature_default`, `--network_default`, `--process_default` will select the corresponding widget on startup. By default the process widget is selected.

- `-s`, `--show_disabled_data` will show data entries in the graph legends even if the lines for that entry are disabled.

- `-C`, `--config` takes in a file path leading to a TOML file. If the file doesn't exist, one will be created.

- `-b`, `--basic` will enable basic mode, removing all graphs from the main interface and condensing data.

- `-t`, `--default_time_value` will set the default time interval graphs will display to (in milliseconds). Lowest is 30 seconds, defaults to 60 seconds.

- `-d`, `--time_delta` will set the amount each zoom in/out action will change the time interval of a graph (in milliseconds). Lowest is 1 second, defaults to 15 seconds.

### Keybindings

#### General

- `q`, `Ctrl-c` to quit. Note if you are currently in the search widget, `q` will not work so you can still type.

- `Esc` to close a dialog window, widget, or exit maximized mode.

- `Ctrl-r` to reset the screen and reset all collected data.

- `f` to freeze the screen from updating with new data. Press `f` again to unfreeze. Note that monitoring will still continue in the background.

- `Ctrl/Shift`-arrow or `H/J/K/L` to navigate between widgets. **Note that on macOS, some keybindings may collide with existing ones; `H/J/K/L` should work however.**

- `Up` or `k` and `Down` or `j` scrolls through the list if the widget is a table (Temperature, Disks, Processes).

- `?` to get a help screen explaining the controls. Note all controls except `Esc` to close the dialog will be disabled while this is open.

- `gg` or `Home` to jump to the first entry of the current table.

- `G` (`Shift-g`) or `End` to jump to the last entry of the current table.

- `Enter` on a widget to maximize the widget.

- `+` to zoom in (reduce time interval, smallest is 30 seconds).

- `-` to zoom out (increase time interval, largest is 10 minutes).

- `=` to reset zoom.

#### CPU

- `/` to allow for enabling/disabling showing certain cores with `Space`.

#### Processes

- `dd` to kill the selected process

- `c` to sort by CPU usage. Sorts in descending order by default. Press again to reverse sorting order.

- `m` to sort by memory usage. Sorts in descending order by default. Press again to reverse sorting order.

- `p` to sort by PID. Sorts in ascending order by default. Press again to reverse sorting order.

- `n` to sort by process name. Sorts in ascending order by default. Press again to reverse sorting order.

- `Tab` to group together processes with the same name. Disables PID sorting. `dd` will now kill all processes covered by that name.

- `Ctrl-f` or `/` to open the search widget.

#### Search widget

- `Tab` to switch between searching for PID and name respectively.

- `Esc` to close.

- `Ctrl-a` and `Ctrl-e` to jump to the start and end of the search bar respectively.

- `Ctrl-u` to clear the current search query.

- `Backspace` to delete one character behind the current cursor position.

- `Delete` to delete one character at the current cursor position.

- `Left` and `Right` arrow keys to move the cursor within the search bar.

- `Alt-c/F1` to toggle ignoring case.

- `Alt-w/F2` to toggle matching the entire word.

- `Alt-r/F3` to toggle using regex.

Note that `q` is disabled while in the search widget.

### Mouse actions

- Scrolling with the mouse will scroll through the currently selected list if the widget is a scrollable table.

- Scrolling on a graph will zoom in (scroll up) or zoom out (scroll down).
