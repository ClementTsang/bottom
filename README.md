# rusttop

A gotop clone, written in Rust.  Mostly done in an effort to learn Rust, while also potentially making a tool that people might want to use.

## Planned features: (copy of gotop)

* CPU usage monitor

* Disk usage (both total and I guess active?)

* Memory usage

* Temperature

* Processes

* Network usage

## Other possible features

* Potentially package managing?

* Theming

* Rearranging?

* Definitely keybinds

* Filtering in processing

## Thanks

* As mentioned, this project is most definitely inspired by [gotop](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop)
