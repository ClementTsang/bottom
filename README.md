# rustop

A top clone, written in Rust.  Inspired by both [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop) and [gotop](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop)

## Installation

### Linux

TODO: Write

### Windows

TODO: Test

### MacOS

Currently, I'm unable to test on MacOS, so I'm not sure how well this will work, if at all.  I'll try to source MacOS hardware to test this application.

## Thanks

* As mentioned, this project is very much inspired by both [gotop](https://github.com/cjbassi/gotop) and [gtop](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop) .

* This application was written with the following libraries:
  * [crossterm](https://github.com/TimonPost/crossterm)
  * [heim](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim)
  * [sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo)
  * [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)
  * [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)

## Why

I was looking to try writing more things in Rust, and I love the gotop tool.  And thus, this project was born.

Also, yes, I realize that gotop has a Rust rewrite branch... I found out about that when I was nearly ready to release the first version.
