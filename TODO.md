# To-Do List

## Want to do

- Bug for too small windows --- probably a TUI bug?

- Scaling in and out (zoom), may need to show zoom levels

- Filtering in processes (that is, allow searching)

- More keybinds (jumping in scrolling (vim bindings?), scaling)

- ~~Add custom error because it's really messy~~ Done, but need to implement across rest of app!

- Efficiency... for example, reduce some redraw logic if possible (ie: no changes to dir sorting)

## Less important

- Minimalist mode

- Ellipsis

- Tests

- Refactoring!

- Modularity

- Mouse support if possible for clicking

- Truncate columns if needed for tables

- Grouping by process

- Deal with async and stuff (remove if not needed)

- Perhaps switch libraries...?
