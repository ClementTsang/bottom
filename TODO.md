# To-Do List

* ~~Get each function working as a POC~~

* ~~Separate each component for readability, finalize project structure~~

* ~~Refreshing - how are we doing that?  Are we allowing individual refresh periods per component?~~

* Write tui display, charting

* Add custom error because it's really messy

* Scrolling event

* Keybindings

~~* FIX PROCESSES AHHHHHH~~

* Refactor everything because it's a mess

* Test for Windows support, mac support

* Efficiency!!!  Make sure no wasted hashmaps, use references, etc.

* Potentially process managing?  Depends on the libraries...

* Filtering in processes (ie: search)
