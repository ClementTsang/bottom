# To-Do List

Note this will probably migrate to GitHub's native Issues; this was mostly for personal use during early stages.

## Want to do

- Travis to automate building

- Scaling in and out (zoom), may need to show zoom levels

- More keybinds (jumping, scaling, help)

- ~~Add custom error because it's really messy~~ Done, but need to implement across rest of app!

- Efficiency... for example, reduce some redraw logic if possible (ie: no changes to dir sorting)

- Filtering in processes (that is, allow searching)

- Help screen

- Probably good to add a "are you sure" to dd-ing...

## Less important

- Rebalance cpu usage in process by using current value (it's currently just summing to 100%)

- Tests

- Refactoring!

- Mouse + key events conflict? Make it so that some events don't clog up the loop if they are not valid keys!

- Modularity

- Mouse support if possible for clicking

- Truncate columns if needed for tables

- Grouping by process

- Deal with async and stuff (remove if not needed)
