# To-Do List

* ~~Get each function working as a POC~~

* ~~Separate each component for readability, finalize project structure~~

* ~~Write tui display, charting~~

* Scaling in and out

* Add custom error because it's really messy

* Remove any ``unwrap()``.

* Scrolling event

* Keybindings

~~* FIX PROCESSES AHHHHHH~~

* Refactor everything because it's a mess
