# Layout - layouts follow a pattern like this:
# [[row]] represents a row in the application.
# [[row.child]] represents either a widget or a column.
# [[row.child.child]] represents a widget.
#
# All widgets must have the type value set to one of ["cpu", "mem", "proc", "net", "temp", "disk", "empty"].
# All layout components have a ratio value - if this is not set, then it defaults to 1.
# The default widget layout:
#[[row]]
#  ratio=30
#  [[row.child]]
#  type="cpu"
#[[row]]
#    ratio=40
#    [[row.child]]
#      ratio=4
#      type="mem"
#    [[row.child]]
#      ratio=3
#      [[row.child.child]]
#        type="temp"
#      [[row.child.child]]
#        type="disk"
#[[row]]
#  ratio=30
#  [[row.child]]
#    type="net"
#  [[row.child]]
#    type="proc"
#    default=true


# Filters - you can hide specific temperature sensors, network interfaces, and disks using filters.  This is admittedly
# a bit hard to use as of now, and there is a planned in-app interface for managing this in the future:
